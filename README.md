WalkingTheDog
=============
Alice Wang, Summer 2013

I've always wanted a dog. Made a little ASCII version of my future pet. It's a single file game. You can just open the file in a browser and play. Hope you like it. 

You can play it here:

*Note: animation breaks when you click all the buttons at once. I'll fix it some day.
